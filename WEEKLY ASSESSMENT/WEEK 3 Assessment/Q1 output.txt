NO

The two functions will not output the same results. The first function, foo1(), 
uses a lowercase "r" in the word "return", which is the correct syntax for the 
JavaScript return statement. The second function, foo2(), uses an uppercase "R" in 
the word "Return", which is not a valid JavaScript syntax and will cause a syntax error.
